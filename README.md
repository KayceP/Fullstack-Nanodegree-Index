# Udacity Fullstack Web Developer Nanodegree Intensive - Projects

![Part of the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://img.shields.io/badge/Udacity-Full%20Stack%20Web%20Developer%20Nanodegree-blue.svg)

In 2017, I was fortunate enough to be awarded a scholarship for this Nanodegree through the Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development as part of the Workforce Innovations for a New Nevada (WINN) program. 

This program taught me how to create dynamic websites and web apps and gave me my foundation for seeking out web vulnerabilities, identifying how attackers could exploit them, and addressing them.

Below is a list of all the projects I created during that intensive; check them out!
